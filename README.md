Data for Frontiers Psychology paper Parikh et al., 2022, titled "The efficacy of downward counterfactual thinking for regulating emotional memories in anxious individuals"

1) Cleaned data file uploaded, titled "longForm_data_summary.csv"
This file has separate rows for each memory provided per participant. A description of the column variables provided below

Variables (columns):
  - Condition (cond) is provided per memory, where 1 = downward counterfactual thinking. 2 = temporal distancing, and 3 = simply remember what occurred
  - Frequency (freq), Valence (val), Arousal (ar), Detail (det), Regret (reg): phenomenological ratings of the memory, on a scale of 1-7. If the column is labeled [rating]_1, that means it was done at the time of initial memory retrieval, during Session 1. [rating]_3 ratings were taken after memory recall during Session 3
  - Source memory accuracy (acc) measures whether the participant accurately identified which simulation condition was used for each memory. 1 = correct, 0 = incorrect
  - Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ_reap and ERQ_supp) scores are separated based on two subscales, the reappraisal and suppression subscales. Each participiant has a single score per subscale, which is why all values are the same within an individual participant.
  - State-Trait Anxiety Questionnaire (STAI) Trait score is used. Each participiant has a single score, which is why all values are the same within an individual participant.
  - Social Desirability Scale (SDS) measures how much participants attest to socially desirable characteristics. Each participiant has a single score, which is why all values are the same within an individual participant.
  - Session 2 Pre-simulation EMG score (S2_pre_EMG) and Session 2 Post-simulation EMG score
